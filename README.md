#### Free and open source toolkit for VR locomotion

http://moonmotionproject.com/

## Movement in Virtual Reality

The Moon Motion toolkit provides Unity developers everything they need to hit the ground running. Drop a ready-to-use VR Player into your scene, equipped with any of the [Moon Motion locomotions](http://moonmotionproject.com/Locomotions.html). Take advantage of key player features such as [object interactivity](http://moonmotionproject.com/SteamVR-Interaction-System.html), [camera smoothing](http://moonmotionproject.com/Smooth-Monitor-Camera-Override.html), and [dynamic player colliders](http://moonmotionproject.com/Dynamic-Player-Colliders.html).

## Built on SteamVR

The toolkit is based on the [SteamVR Interaction System](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steamvr_unity_plugin/tree/master/Assets/SteamVR/InteractionSystem), allowing for a consistent Valve approach to interactivity across all experiences.

## New to VR development?

Now's the perfect time to get started. VR is a blue ocean, and by using this toolkit for free you can literally hit the ground running. Let's create moving experiences!
