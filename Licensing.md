## Licensing

### Keep in mind the source licenses while working with Moon Motion. They are quite permissive, but need to be included and receive proper mention in your projects. 

#### All assets in Moon Motion are under the [MIT license](https://tldrlegal.com/license/mit-license), with the following exceptions:

##### [Assets/Plugins/Moon Motion Toolkit/Plugins](/Assets/Plugins/Moon%20Motion%20Toolkit/Plugins):

- Most of the plugins are either offered as part of Moon Motion or simply follow Unity Asset Store terms.
- However, both of the Valve plugins, the [Unity SteamVR Plugin](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steamvr_unity_plugin) and the [Moondust](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Moondust) assets, contain their own licenses which you should familiarize yourself with.
- Note that any project made with Moon Motion must continue to follow the [Unity SteamVR Plugin](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steamvr_unity_plugin)'s license, as it is core to Moon Motion functionality. [Moondust](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Moondust) assets, on the other hand, are only used in the example scenes, as laid out below.

##### [Assets/Plugins/Moon Motion Toolkit/Scenes](Assets/Plugins/Moon%20Motion%20Toolkit/Scenes):

- If you are going to use the skybox from either of the example scenes, pay attention to the [Moondust](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Moondust) license.
